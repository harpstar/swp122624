            <ul>
              <li>
                Job Growth: Employment of fish and game wardens (which includes
                aquaculture workers) is projected to grow by 7% from 2021 to
                2031, which is average growth for all occupations. However, the
                aquaculture industry itself, especially with the increasing
                demand for farm-raised seafood, is expected to see stronger
                growth
              </li>
              <li>
                Factors Driving Growth: Increasing global demand for sustainable
                seafood, new aquaculture technologies, and expansion in fish
                farming operations
              </li>
